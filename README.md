# NHL-Elo-Leaderboard
Introductory Web Scraping + Rating Systems Project.

The code scrapes data from NHL's stats website and inputs each game into a simple formula that returns an Elo rating for each team, and outputs the table into a .csv file.
This also takes record of a team's number of wins, draws, losses, and games played.
